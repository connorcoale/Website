## Website
The website is written in HTML and CSS with Bootstrap. I spent about a week teaching myself how to do some basic web design because I 
needed a personal website, and also just because I was looking for a fun side project. I'm pretty happy with how it turned.

I'm hosting using GitHub Pages because it's free (woohoo!) and using NameCheap for DNS. It's a pretty easy system to set up which is nice.

Thanks for stopping by!
